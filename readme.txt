Add Twitter Card markup to individual posts. Supports summary, photo, and player types.

== Description ==

Generate inline content previews on Twitter.com and Twitter clients by including [Twitter Card](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) HTML meta elements for individual posts.

All cards are a Twitter Card summary by default. Tap into the `twitter_card_properties` filter to reference the Twitter accounts of your site or author.

Test your site's Twitter Card display through [Twitter's card preview tool](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/preview).

== Filters ==

* `twitter_cards_properties` - act on an array of properties before they are output to the page
* `twitter_cards_htmlxml` - override the default treatment of `html` with `xml`. XML will self-close the meta void element ( "<element />" vs. "<element>" )

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't you support feature X? =

I wrote this plugin for my own site, [NiallKennedy.com](http://www.niallkennedy.com/ "Niall Kennedy"), added some slight flexibility through filters, and released the plugin on GitHub as [a PHP library](https://github.com/niallkennedy/twitter-cards-php "Twitter Cards generator PHP") with [a WordPress plugin wrapper](https://github.com/niallkennedy/twitter-cards "Twitter Cards WordPress plugin"). I use summary cards for my site's articles. If you would like to add better support for photos or videos exposed to Twitter you can fork my work and optionally send some code in a pull request.

= How do I add my Twitter account? =

First you need to hook into the filter from code in your theme or site plugin(s). You can add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file or create a new file in `wp-content/mu-plugins/twitter-cards.php` or something similar.

`add_filter( 'twitter_cards_properties', 'twitter_custom' );`

Next you need to modify the array passed to the filter with your own values.

	function twitter_custom( $twitter_card ) {
		if ( is_array( $twitter_card ) ) {
			$twitter_card['creator'] = '@niall';
			$twitter_card['creator:id'] = '1085';
		}
		return $twitter_card;
	}

The values generated by the plugin are passed to your new function for manipulation before output.

Since Twitter API 1.0 was shut down, it is more difficult to find your Twitter ID. A few options:
http://mytwitterid.com/
http://www.idfromuser.com/


Your Twitter screenname may change but your Twitter ID will remain the same. Grab both while you are setting up your site to provide Twitter with the best data.

= You forgot to include a trailing slash on meta elements =

The plugin outputs HTML-style void elements without a trailing slash by default. Add XML-style trailing slashes by returning a value of `xml` on the `twitter_cards_htmlxml` filter.
